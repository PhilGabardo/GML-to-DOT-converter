# GML-to-DOT-converter
A tool to translate graphs defined in GML to DOT.

Read GMLDot.pdf for details.


To generate the ANTLR4 file (GMLDot.g4), the tex file (GMLDot.tex) and all of the test cases (test*.gml and expected*.dot):
1. Install nuweb from https://sourceforge.net/projects/nuweb/.
2. Copy the nuweb executable to the project directory.
3. Run ./nuweb -n GMLDot.w`

The ANTLR4 program can then be generated by (assuming you have antlr4 installed):
1. Run antlr4 GMLDot.g4`
2. Run javac *.java`

The ANTLR4 program can be tested with a test gml file by running:
	cat <TEST_GML_FILE> | grun GMLDot graph

The output can be piped to a DOT file.



The DOT file can be converted to png by:
1. Install DOT from http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php`
2. Run dot -Tpng infile.dot -o outfile.png`
